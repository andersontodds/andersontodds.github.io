This is my personal website.  It's based off the [Minimal Mistakes](https://mmistakes.github.io/minimal-mistakes/) theme for Jekyll.  If you want to learn how to build your own, I highly recommend reading the documentation there.  You'll need Jekyll, Ruby, Python, a Github account...you really should just read the documentation [here](https://mmistakes.github.io/minimal-mistakes/docs/quick-start-guide/#starting-fresh).
