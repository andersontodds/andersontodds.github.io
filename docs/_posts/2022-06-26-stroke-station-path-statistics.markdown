Quick post to show this animation of WWLLN stroke-to-station paths for March 2022, averaged in 10-minute windows of time of day.  Next, I'll try simulating WWLLN stations in new locations (such as nearer the North Pole) to see how higher-latitude stations would impact our ability to sense the lower ionosphere with WWLLN-like VLF receivers, using lightning sferics as a probe signal.
