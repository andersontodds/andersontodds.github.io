crispy potatoes:
1. using either fingerlings, or small round potatoes halved into approximately fingerling size, boil from cold until easily pierced with sharp paring knife
2. put them on a baking sheet, and smash them a little with another baking sheet. alternatively, use a knife, or metal flat thing, or whatever.  They should still be at least 1/2" thick, but now with two flat sides and some good craggles and cracks
2. make some dank cooking oil:
	1c canola, veggie or perhaps light olive oil
	several (6?) crushed cloves of garlic
	several (2-3) springs of herbs
	cook over low heat until garlic is lightly browned
	strain into another pan
3. fry potatoes in this oil, turning over, until lightly golden brown
4. make seasoning paste:
	crushed garlic from earlier
	lemon zest
	chop until finely chopped
5. combine potatoes and seasoning paste + kosher salt + black pepper

instant pot fried rice situation
from here: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=--P6IGVLVZo
copied comment:
"I made this in the instant pot and it turned out really good! Here are the measurements I used:
	1 1/2 cups rice
	1 1/2 cups water
	1 large potato
	1 large portobello mushroom
	~1 cup of carrots
	~1/3 pound of smoked sausage
	2 cloves garlic
	1 1/2 tbsp oil
	1 1/2 tbsp soy sauce
	1 tbsp oyster sauce
	1 tsp salt
	1/2 tsp pepper
	3-4 eggs
The only changes I made were to sauté the garlic with the vegetables and also I didn’t boil the water with the vegetables, I just added it in with the rice."
