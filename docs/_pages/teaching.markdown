ESS 205: Access to Space

Spring 2016, 2017, 2018, 2019, 2022

Course description: *Group development of student experiments to the outer rim of our atmosphere and the beginning of space; investigation of stratosphere, mesosphere, thermosphere, magnetosphere, development of exploration packages; basic electronic fabrication, global positioning, radio tracking, expectations at high altitudes. Open to all disciplines. No previous experience of electronics required.*

The purpose of Access to Space is to take undergraduate students through the process of conducting a mission-based atmospheric/space science experiment.  Over the course of the quarter, students formulate science questions, prepare and present proposals, design and fabricate electronic instrument payloads, launch the payloads on a sounding balloon, analyze their data, and present their findings in a final report.  We cover science topics in atmospheric and space science in lecture, and provide an introduction to electronic circuits in lecture and lab.

During my experience as a TA for ESS 205 I have advised student groups working on a range of experiments, from relatively simple circuits measuring ambient air temperature and pressure, to UV photodiode circuits, cosmic ray counters using Geiger tubes, and many other kinds of sensors.
